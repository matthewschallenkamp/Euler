# Euler
A repository where I store code used to complete various Project Euler problems.
Username is matthewschallenkamp @ projecteuler.net
# C++
The currently-in-progress file is main.cpp.
It should have the number of the problem being worked on in it.
After a problem is finished, it will be renamed to {problemnumber}.cpp.
Unfinished problems will have a u placed at the start of their name.
# Lisp
The currently-in-progress file (if there is one) is main.lisp.
It should have the number of the problem being worked on in it.
After a problem is finished, it will be renamed to {problemnumber}.lisp.
Unfinished problems will have a u placed at the start of their name.
Useful functions will often be pulled out into mylib.lisp, which may be included elsewhere.
# Lua
The currently-in-progress file (if there is one) is main.lua.
It should have the number of the problem being worked on in it.
After a problem is finished, it will be renamed to {problemnumber}.lua.
